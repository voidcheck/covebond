About covebond:
CoveBond is a small project to show a mini chemistry education iq test to make checmical bonds with given elements. This project is a very basic level for the test creation.

Technology usage:
p5.js is been used to create this basic level as its light and go very handy with plain js ( with both class and without class structure ). 
p5.js provides variety of pre-defined methods and objects that can be used to build 2D games as well as 3D. I have tried to integrate sounds for the test game, p5.js provides p5.sound library for integrating sounds in your project.
