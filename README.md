Educational game test created for the subject chemistry where student need to create a covalent bond with the given elements.

#About covebond:
CoveBond is a small project to show a mini chemistry education iq test to make checmical bonds with given elements. This project is a very basic level for the test creation.

#Technology: p5.js

#Technology usage:
p5.js is been used to create this basic level as its light and go very handy with plain js ( with both class and without class structure ). 
p5.js provides variety of pre-defined methods and objects that can be used to build 2D games as well as 3D. I have tried to integrate sounds for the test game, p5.js provides p5.sound library for integrating sounds in your project.


How to install:
Just clone the project to your htdocs folder for xampp server or you can create an express project where you can copy project files and run directly in browser.
Note: Running directly with VSCode (launch against chrome) can cause CORS error when preloading sounds.
